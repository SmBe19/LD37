LD37 Story
=========

Summary
------------

A castle is under siege. This has been the case for several weeks. The old insane magician has recently accepted a new apprentice, the player. However, he is killed by a catapult before he can pass on a significant amount of knowledge. Just before his death, he remembers an old artifact that was stored in room 51, which might be the key to winning the battle and ending the siege. He manages to relay that information to the player in his dying breath. However, nobody listens to the insane old mage and even less his newly accepted and equally insane apprentice. So the player has to make his way to room 51 on his own.
Once he gets there, he finds a box that seems to emit magical energy. When you unpack it, it turns into a dragon. He subsequently kills all of the invaders and (almost) none of the defenders.

Dialogue

**Intro**

Mage: “Once upon a time, there was a cute little castle on a hill.”  
[show Disney-like castle ( like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg-FFcVd8c )]  
Mage: “Unfortunately, that castle was attacked by an enemy army and is now under siege.”  
[show catapult shot flying like the twinkling star in the video, except flying towards the castle]  
Mage: “It would seem that there is only one hope …”  
[stone hits the castle]  
Mage: “AAaaaah! I was hit!”  
[Image changes to in game situation, in mage building. The mage lies half under a rock. Only his upper body and head are looking out from under it. The player stands beside him and listens to him ]  
Mage: “Listen to me closely… ehm what was your name? Ah, right, Merlin.  
There is only one hope for all of us  
This siege turned out disastrous.  
That hope is the one room, room 51.  
If you don’t get to it, we’ll be overrun.
Eugh.”  
[Mage dies and player is prompted to press F to pay respects]
