Summary
------------

A castle is under siege. This has been the case for several weeks. The old insane magician has recently accepted a new apprentice, the player. However, he is killed by a catapult before he can pass on a significant amount of knowledge. Just before his death, he remembers an old artifact that was stored in room 51, which might be the key to winning the battle and ending the siege. He manages to relay that information to the player in his dying breath. However, nobody listens to the insane old mage and even less his newly accepted and equally insane apprentice. So the player has to make his way to room 51 on his own.
Once he gets there, he finds a box that seems to emit magical energy. When you unpack it, it turns into a dragon. He subsequently kills all of the invaders and (almost) none of the defenders.
