LD37 Story
=========

Summary
------------

A castle is under siege. This has been the case for several weeks. The old insane magician has recently accepted a new apprentice, the player. However, he is killed by a catapult before he can pass on a significant amount of knowledge. Just before his death, he remembers an old artifact that was stored in room 51, which might be the key to winning the battle and ending the siege. He manages to relay that information to the player in his dying breath. However, nobody listens to the insane old mage and even less his newly accepted and equally insane apprentice. So the player has to make his way to room 51 on his own.
Once he gets there, he finds a box that seems to emit magical energy. When you unpack it, it turns into a dragon. He subsequently kills all of the invaders and (almost) none of the defenders.

Dialogue
--------

**Intro**

Mage: “Once upon a time, there was a cute little castle on a hill.”  
[show Disney-like castle ( like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKg-FFcVd8c )]  
Mage: “Unfortunately, that castle was attacked by an enemy army and is now under siege.”  
[show catapult shot flying like the twinkling star in the video, except flying towards the castle]  
Mage: “It would seem that there is only one hope …”  
[stone hits the castle]  
Mage: “Aaaaaah! I was hit!”  
[Image changes to in game situation, in mage laboratory. The mage lies half under a rock. Only his upper body and head are looking out from under it. The player stands beside him and listens to him.]  
Mage: “Listen to me closely… ehm what was your name? Ah, right, Merlin.  
There is only one hope for all of us  
This siege turned out disastrous.  
That hope is the one room, room 51.  
If you don’t get to it, we’ll be overrun.  
Eugh.”  
[Mage dies and player is prompted to press F to pay respects]

**Monologue**

Generally, when trying to use an item when it isn’t appropriate, say one of these:  
“I don’t think that’s going to work.”  
“That doesn’t make sense.”  
“Bad idea.”  
“That’s not how the programmer envisioned it.”  
“This won’t get us ahead.”  
“I should try something else.”

When trying to use a potion on a wrong person:
“I think there’s a better use for that.”
“Maybe someone else is better suited.”
“Now is not the time for this.”

**With Characters**

*Maid (in front of tavern)*

Maid: “Oh my god, I just saw that this stone flew into your master’s house. Are you all right?”  
You: “Yeah, I’m good, thank you. How are you?”  
Maid: Well what about your master?”  
You: “He didn’t make it. But he was pretty old anyway.”  
Maid: “… I don’t know what to say”  
You: “His last words were about Room 51. Do you know what that is?”  
Maid: “Of course I do. How do you not know? Room 51 is the room at the top of the castle tower.”  
You: “Can you take me there?”  
Maid: “Oh no, the king will not allow anyone to enter that room.”  
You: “But why?”  
Maid: “Nobody really knows. The king never talks about it.”  
You: “But master said Room 51 is our only hope or something.”  
Maid: “Well I am really sorry, but I can’t help you”  
You: “Well then I’m going to have to ask the king myself.”  

*Boy (in Inner Ward)*

Boy: “Well if it isn’t the apprentice. You survived that projectile? Quite a shame.”  
You: “Whatever, Jake. Did you steal the elixicon?”  
Boy: “Maybe. Depends on your ability to pay. If you give me a gold piece, maybe I will talk”  
You: “Fuck you, Jake”  

After gold is transferred

Jake: “It was a pleasure doing business with you, here’s your stupid old book.”  
You: “Fuck you, Jake”

*King’s Bodyguard*

You: “Hi”  
Bodyguard: “…”  
You: “How are you doing?”  
Bodyguard: “…”  
You: “Well bye then, I guess.”

*King*

You: “Your Majesty.”  
King: “Oh loyal subject, what is your inquiry?”  
You: “I am here on a quest given to me by my master. I need to access Room 51 as soon as possible.”  
King: “Impossible! Room 51 is not to be entered by lowly peasants such as you.”  
You: “But it is our only hope to survive this siege. My master said this:  
There is only one hope for all of us  
This siege turned out disastrous.  
That hope is the one room, room 51.  
If you don’t …“  
King: “Silence! Room 51 is not to be used under any circumstances. We are facing a great crisis here; your master’s ridiculous prophecies do not help! Tell min to keep his insane ramblings to himself!”  
You: “He’s dead.”  
King: “I … didn’t know that. … Well good riddance, I say! Now get out of my sight.”  

When you talk to him again:

King: “Didn’t you hear me? Get out of here!”

*Corrupt Guard*

Guard: “This tower is off limits for you, kid, I’m afraid.”  
Me: “I need to get to room 51. I know that it’s at the top of this tower, let me through.”  
Guard: “No way, kid. Keep your childish curiosity away from my tower.”   
Me: “It’s a matter of life and death.”  
Guard: “That makes no difference to me. I’m not about to risk my job for your drama. Not in this economy, anyway.”  
Me: “You are worried about money? Well maybe I can help with that.”  
Guard: “Now we’re getting somewhere”

If asked again:  
Guard: “Do you have anything to offer?”

After you give emerald:  
Guard: “It would seem like your presence in this tower truly is a necessity. But whatever happens to you, it is none of my concern.”

If asked again:  
Guard: “No refunds.”

*Drunk Soldier*

Soldier: “Heeeeeey theeere. Are youuu [hick] here to bring me more mead?”  

If asked again:  
Soldier: “Shome more meaaaad, pleashe.”  

If given mead:  
Soldier: “Sha-Shank youuuuu. …” [drinks mead and falls unconscious]
